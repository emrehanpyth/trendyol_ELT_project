# trendyol_ELT_project
 I have extracted laptop data from Trendyol and saved it csv format. 
 Thereafter, the conversion to raw data was performed and loaded to both csv and database.
 Finally, I analyzed the processed data with sql commands.
 During project, I utilized several python library such as numpy, pandas, sqlite3, datetime, airflow.
